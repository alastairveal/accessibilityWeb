        <p class="paragraphText">A widget is a part of a page that enables the user to perform a function.  Widgets are typically made up of a set of elements that are bunched together.  Examples of widgets include forms where users can enter data, navigation menus or search boxes.  This page contains examples of a variety of different widgets.</p>

        <section role="region" aria-labelledby="formsAndValidation">
      		<h2 class="headingTopPadding" id="formsAndValidation">Forms and Validation</h2>
          <hr />
          <p>A form allows the user to enter data which is usually sent to a server for processing. Forms usually consist of a combination of text boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes and drop down menus. Each part of the form where a user edits data is known as a field. Forms often have submit buttons, so when the user has entered all the data that they wish to, data is sent to the server by pressing the submit button.</p>
          <h3>Form Validation</h3>
          <p>Most forms have some kind of validation. Users make mistakes when inputting data. Forms have systems to check that the user has not put in any erroneous data. Typically when the user puts in incorrect data and then activates the submit button, instead of the data being submitted to the website, the form highlights to the user what information is wrong. By convention, fields which are required often indicated by the asterisk character '*', usually read by screen reading software as 'star'.</p>
          <h3>Forms and Aria</h3>
          <p>Some forms, when coded well, announce extra information to screen reader users which is not visible to sighted users. The technology to do this is known as 'Aria'. Examples of Aria include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Aria Invalid: </strong>Annouces whether or not the data entered into a field is invalid. Screen reader announces 'invalid entry' when data in the field is invalid field has the focus (e.g. an email address with no '@' symbol.). There is no announcement when the data is correct.</li>
            <li><strong>Aria Required: </strong>Annouces whether or not a field is required. Screen reader announces 'required' after the label is read when the field has the focus. </li>
          </ul>


          <h3>Form Example</h3>
          <p>The example form below includes a text box for an email address and two fields for a password. This is typical of the kind of form used when signing up for a service. There are a number of criteria that must be met before the submitted data will be accepted. The email address must be a valid email address. The password must be at least 8 characters long, contain at least one number and one capital letter. The two passwords must match. The email address and both the password fields must be filled in. If any of fields are not filled in, or are filled in incorrectly, an error message will appear next to each field where there is a mistake. These error messages are announced to screen reader users as they appear. The error message will appear when the user presses the ‘Submit’ button. Try filling out the form incorrectly and correctly and seeing the results. Note that no actual data is stored by AccessibilityWeb.</p>

        <section role="region" aria-labelledby="megaMenu">
          <h2 class="headingTopPadding" id="megaMenu" tabindex="-1">Mega Menu</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            A mega menu is a common feature on many websites.  A mega menu is a navigation menu that helps the user find content within a website.  Mega menus are created in a variety of different ways and some are not well designed with regards to accessibility.  A mega menu consist of a top link and a set of ‘sub links’.  When the top link is activated, a set of ‘sub links’ appear.  The top link describes a general overall topic and the ‘sub links’, are links to a more specific part of the web page.  For example on a groceries website, the top links could be ‘Fruit’ and ‘Vegetables’.  The sub links for ‘Fruit’ could be ‘Apples’, ‘Bananas’ etc, and the sub links for ‘Vegetables’ could be ‘Carrots’, ‘Broccoli’ etc.  Well designed navigation menus will have a number of extra pieces of information made available to screen reader users using aria code and other accessibility features.  This includes:
          </p>
          <ul class="megaMenuList">
            <li><strong>Aria Expanded:</strong>  When Aria Expanded is used, the state of the menu, either collapsed or expanded, is announced to screen reader users. The example mega menu here consists of a top link ‘AccessibilityWeb’, referring to the contents of this site. When the link is activated, a list of links appears which takes the user to specific page on the website. Press the TAB key, once the list of links has been opened, to navigate down the links. Activating the ‘AccessibilityWeb’ link once more closes the list of links, and the word 'collapsed' will be heard by screen reader users. </li>
            <li><strong>Link and Button:</strong>  The top link appears to sighted users as a link and follows normal link behaviour.  For screen reader users, the link is announced as a button. Generally speaking, a link takes the user somewhere, and a button activates something.  With a navigation top link, the user is not being taken anywhere, activating the top link simply opens a menu, and therefore it is easier to conceive of the top link as a button.  There is a bit of code that announces the link as a button.  To conform to normal button behaviour, the top link will open the sub menu both when pressing the ‘SPACEBAR’ and ‘ENTER’ key.  Normally links will only open on the ‘ENTER’ key. The top menu link does not appear in the links list for screen reader users.</li>
            <li><strong>Arrow Key Navigation:</strong> The sub menu links are navigable via the UP and DOWN ARROW KEYS, as well as using the TAB and SHIFT + TAB keys.  This makes the menu behave a bit more like a menu in an application.</li>
            <li><strong>Aria-Current:</strong>  The current page is the ‘Widgets’ page.  A link to the ‘Widgets’ page appears in the list of sub links.  To help screen reader users know that the ‘Widgets’ page is the current page, this is announced.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 class="headingTopPadding" id="tooltip" tabindex="-1">Tooltip</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>A tooltip is a textbox that appears when the user moves the mouse over an element, or when the element has the focus.  It provides useful extra information about the element.  The tooltip disappears when the mouse or focus is moved away from the element.  If properly designed, the content of the tooltip is read aloud to screen reader users.  Sometimes the tooltip can obscure other items on the page from view.  For this reason, a well designed tooltip can also be closed by pressing the ESCAPE key on the keyboard.  The example below has an email edit box, where a tooltip appears when the mouse is over the edit box or the focus is on the edit box. </p>
          <label class="exampleMarginLeft" for="email">Email</label>
          <input type="text" id="email" aria-required="true" aria-describedby="tooltipContent" class="tooltipExample" >

          <h2 class="headingTopPadding" id="carousel" tabindex="-1">Carousel</h2>
          <hr>
          <p class="paragraphText">
            Carousels are widgets which can be used to squeeze more information visually on a web page.  They can be tricky to use for disabled users.  A carousel usually has a timer as well as next and previous buttons.  Starting the timer makes the content in the carousel change on a regular basis.  The carousel is the whole widget including the controls, and the slide is the bit of information that changes.  Many carousels start rotating content as soon as the page is loaded, which can be distracting and disorientating.</p>
            <p> Below is an example of a carousel on a timer.  The content changes every 3 seconds once the play button is started.  In the carousel there are three different slides, with a picture of the following three dishes; frittata, pizza and quiche.  When one of the dishes is visible, the other slides cannot be seen or read out but a screen reader.

        <section role="region" aria-labelledby="tabPanel">
          <h2 class="headingTopPadding" id="tabPanel" tabindex="-1">Tab Panel</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            A tab panel, like a carousel, is a way squeezing more content visually on a page.  A tab panel consists of three parts.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Tab Panel:</strong>  The main area of the tab that contains the content.  Only one tab panel is visible and screen reader accessible at one time.  </li>
            <li><strong>Tab:</strong> This is the title of the tab panel.  For example a tab panel describing a pizza, would have a tab that reads ‘Pizza’.  Note this is different to the TAB key.</li>
            <li><strong>Tab List:</strong> The tab list is a list of all the tabs.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Activating the tab (bit at the top), by clicking on the tab or by navigating to the tab using the TAB key or ARROW keys reveals the content of the tab in the tab panel.  Only the content in the active tab panel can be seen or read out loud by a screen reader.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
            For keyboard only users, to change the selected tab, use the TAB key to enter the tab list.  Once in the tab list, use the LEFT and RIGHT ARROW keys to move to the next tab.  For screen reader users, the total number of tabs in the tab list should be announced when entering the tab list.  To move out of the tab list and get to the content in the tab panel, press the TAB key.  To move back to the tab list from the tab panel, press the SHIFT key and TAB key.  Whether or not the current tab is selected will be announced to screen reader users with the word "selected".  This is generated using a bit of code called 'Aria-Selected'.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following example has three tab panels describing different dishes; frittata, pizza and quiche.
          </p>
          <div class="exampleMarginLeft">

          <p class="paragraphText">Many forms require users to input dates. This typically consists of an input box, which the user can type in the date that they want. To help users get the right dates, date input boxes often have a date picker tool. This is a calendar that
            appears to help the user find the right dates. There are many different kinds of date picker calendars, so there is no one simple way in which a user who cannot use a mouse can access them. The simplest way to use a date input box for non-mouse users is
            just to type in the date, in the format required. </p>
          <p class="paragraphText">Below is an example of a date input box with a date picker. As the user types in a date a calendar pops up. It is not necessary to use the popup calendar, users can just type in the date needed using the DD/MM/YYYY format (e.g. 1st of
