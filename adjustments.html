In Windows, using Chrome, Firefox, Edge or Internet Explorer, press on the CTRL & + keys to zoom in and the CTRL & - keys to zoom out.

            <p class="paragraphText">The text size can be enlarged, without enlarging any of the other elements on the page. Sometimes this may provide a better user experience, if zooming in causes content to become difficult to read or navigate. Methods for changing the text size differ from browser to browser. Font sizes can be changed in the standard view in Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari. In Edge to change the font size, users need to change the view to Reading View. Reading View in Edge is not yet covered by AccessiblityWeb.</p>

                To change the font size in Firefox, go to the more button on the top right of the browser (a ‘hamburger’ button with three horizontal lines). Then select 'Options' from the menu that appears. Alternatively press and releasing the ALT key, then press the T key, and then the O key will open the options menu.  Use the TAB key or scroll down to get to the ‘Language and Appearance’ section and activate the ‘Advanced’ button, which opens the font window. In the font window, first uncheck the ‘Allow pages to choose their own fonts, instead of your selections above’. Then click or SHIFT & TAB up to the ‘Minimum font size’ drop down menu and select a desired minimum font size.

          <section class="relativeSection" role="region" aria-labelledby="responsive">
            <h2 class="headingTopPadding" id="responsive" tabindex="-1">Responsive Websites</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="paragraphText">When changing the zoom or text size, users may find that some content is lost, becomes unreadable or does not change in size as expected. A responsive website is a site where users can both change the text size and the content is still accessible, within certain limitations, regardless of the size of browser window (viewport) and the user's zoom and text size preferences. What this means in practice is that all of the content should remain visible regardless of the viewport or zoom and text settings. In addition, content should generally ‘reflow’ as the viewport gets narrower. The user should not have to scroll to the left or the right hand side of the page if the zoom settings have been changed. Ideally, elements that can be side by side on a wider viewport, will end up one above the other on a narrower viewport or when the zoom is changed. The AccessibilityWeb website, with a deliberate exception in a small section of this page, is designed to reflow. For example, as the page becomes narrower or is zoomed in, the menu at the top is replace by a button with a menu with the page headings, and the page contents section, used to aid navigation in the page, disappears. Unfortunately, not all websites are designed to reflow properly. In the grey box immediately beneath this paragraph is an example of bad design that does not respond well when the zoom is increased or the page size is narrowed.</p>

            <div class="overlapDiv exampleMarginLeft">
              <p class="paragraphText"><strong>Overlapping and Overspilling: </strong>The text in this section will start to overlap other sections and content on the right hand side will not be visible as the zoom is increased. Press the CTRL & + keys on your browser or COMMAND & + keys if using Safari on Mac to zoom in and see what happens.</p>

            <h2 class="headingTopPadding" id="extension" tabindex="-1">Extensions</h2>
            <hr>
            <p class="paragraphText">An extension is a piece of software that can be added to the browser which means the browser can do more things. There are a range of accessibility extensions that can change how web pages are displayed as well as adding extra functionality, such as reading aloud the content. Below are some links to extensions for the Chrome, Firefox and Edge browsers. Please note that AccessiblityWeb takes no responsibility for any harm caused by installing these extensions. Installing any extensions listed in the links below is entirely at the user’s own risk.</p>
